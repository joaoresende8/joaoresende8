I am a OutSystems Developer driven by a passion for technology and a strong desire to build impactful solutions.

My journey into software development was motivated by my curiosity and the will to create. I built my foundation by completing Harvard University's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science course, where I learned core concepts in algorithms and data structures. It was with OutSystems that all these concepts brilliantly came together in a single environment, sparking my passion for building robust, high-quality applications.

My OutSystems Associate Developer certification reflects my commitment to continuous learning and my dedication to mastering the platform
